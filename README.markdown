# dotfiles: ~/.*

My attempt at dotfiles. Mostly to make my multi-machine lifestyle easier, but
also here for your enjoyment. Clone this repo to ~/.dotfiles, then run
ruby install.rb to link all files ending with .symlink into your home directory.


## My setup

Mac OS X on the desktop, Ubuntu on the server.

 * Mac: brew, macvim
 * Linux: tmux, vim
 * Both: zsh


## Thanks

Symlinking strategy heavily inspired by
[holman's dotfiles](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles),
which in turn were inspired by
[ryanb's dotfiles](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles).

Also, thanks to all those random people I copied great tidbits off over the
last 10 years.
