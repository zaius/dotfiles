# dotfiles: ~/.*
My attempt at dotfiles. Mostly to make my multi-machine lifestyle easier, but
also here for your enjoyment. Clone this repo to ~/.dotfiles, then run 
ruby install.rb to link all files ending with .symlink into your home directory.


## My setup
Mac OS X on the desktop, Ubuntu on the server.

* Mac: brew, macvim
* Linux: tmux, vim
* Both: zsh


## Thanks
Symlinking strategy heavily inspired by 
[holman's dotfiles](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles),
which in turn were inspired by
[ryanb's dotfiles](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles).

The ERB implementation was based on ryanb's rakefile as well.

Also, thanks to all those random people I copied great tidbits off over the 
last 10 years.
