# dotfiles: ~/.*

My attempt at dotfiles. Mostly to make my multi-machine lifestyle easier, but
also here for your enjoyment. Clone this repo to ~/.dotfiles, then run
bash install.sh to link all files ending with .symlink into your home directory.


## My setup

Mac OS X on the desktop, Ubuntu on the server.

 * Mac: brew, vimr
 * Linux: tmux, neovim
 * Both: zsh


## Base16

Color codes generated by base16 - http://janniks.github.io/harmonic16/

```bash
./base16 -s ~/.dotfiles/zaius.yml
cp output/
cp output/vim/base16-zaius.vim ~/.vim/colors
cp output/shell/base16-zaius.dark.sh ~/.dotfiles/zsh/
```
